 RA-Neo•Geo

 This is a stand-alone Mod of SuperrSonic core. 
 -----
 BIOS "neogeo.zip" must be placed in the folder where your roms are located!
 EXAMPLE...  SD > roms > Arcade > Neo Geo > bstars2.zip
             SD > roms > Arcade > Neo Geo > neogeo.zip
 -----
 I have left my .cfg files in case you want the emulator pre-configured.
 -----
 Turbo is enabled in Input Setting to button 44 (B on Wiimote).
 Hold down B button on Wiimote while pressing 1 or 2 for turbo speed.
 Change turbo speed in...   Settings > Input > Turbo Period
 -----
 There are 2 themes included... "Fight" & "Metal"...
 -----
 Neo VM is the default core. From my testing as well as @Charco testing,
 all "Normal" Neo•Geo games are working properly. However, when playing 
 VM games, you must load the VM core again before loading another VM
 game directly after...OR you will be greeted with "Error Not Enough Memory".
 Loading a "Normal" Neo•Geo game directly after a VM game works without issues.
